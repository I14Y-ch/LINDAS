# I14Y to LINDAS
## Overview
In this repository there are three types of mappings from json to rdf: 
- **concept2sharedDimension** : mapping of I14Y Concepts to Lindas Shared Dimensions.
- **CPSV_mapping** : mapping of PublicServices in json format to rdf and ttl (not mantained). 
- **DCAT_mapping** : mapping of DCAT classes (Dataset, Catalog, Distribution, DataService) in json format to rdf and ttl (not mantained).

Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook that contains some Stardog queries examples (how to POST, PUT, DELETE requests on LINDAS database) is available. More documentation about Stardog can be found [here](https://docs.stardog.com/developing/http-api).
